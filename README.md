Texture Compression in Unity
This project explores texture compression techniques in Unity to optimize performance for WebGL and mobile platforms. It demonstrates the use of different compression to reduce memory usage while maintaining visual quality. 
The goal is to improve loading times, reduce GPU overhead, and enhance overall rendering efficiency without compromising texture fidelity.
